# Conclusion - 
• Analyzed spam data and developed three pipelines using TF-IDF vectors, manual features, and combined TF-IDF vectors. The evaluation metric used was
F0.5 giving slightly more importance to precision than recall for this imbalanced dataset.

• Achieved a maximum F0.5 score of 0.9458 using an XGBoost Classifier which turned out to be the best model.
