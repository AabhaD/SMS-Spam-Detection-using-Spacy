### Conclusion - 
* Analyzed spam data and developed three pipelines using TF-IDF vectors, manual features, and combined TF-IDF vectors. The evaluation metric used was
F0.5 giving slightly more importance to precision than recall for this imbalanced dataset.
* Achieved a maximum F0.5 score of **0.9458** using an **XGBoost Classifier** which turned out to be the best model.
